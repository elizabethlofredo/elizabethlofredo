## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Eli! ðŸ™‚ a Software Engineer based in Montevideo, Uruguay.

With a passion for front-end development, I thrive on collaborating with designers and product teams to bring ideas to life. âœ¨ Over the past 8 years, I have developed my leadership skills and technical expertise.

Outside work, I love traveling, practicing Pilates, and enjoying a good series, especially those with mind-blowing, unexpected endings.
